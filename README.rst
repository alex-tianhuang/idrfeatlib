==========

Welcome to `idrfeatlib`, the beginnings of library for general extensible
sequence feature analysis. The docs live in the repo at the path
`docs/build/index.html` and you can open them by running::

    $ git clone https://github.com/alex-tianhuang/idrfeatlib .
    $ cd idrfeatlib

Then to open the docs, you can either click the file at `docs/build/index.html`
using a web browser or run::

    $ open docs/build/index.html # Safari/default on MacOS
    $ google-chrome docs/build/index.html # with Google Chrome, similar for Firefox, etc.
